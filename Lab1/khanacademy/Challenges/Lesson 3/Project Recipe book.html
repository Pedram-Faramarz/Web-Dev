        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In this super simple egg fried rice recipe we use pantry and fridge staples, but the beauty of basic fried rice recipes is that you can always adjust the ingredients based on what you happen to have on hand at any given time.

The real secret here is to use a large fry pan or wok on a very high heat so the rice is fried and golden, rather than steamed or gluggy. Cooking it this way ensures the fried rice still has bite and absorbs the lovely flavours of the bacon and soy, without resembling a risotto!
